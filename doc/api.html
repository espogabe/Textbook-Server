<h1>Gabriel Esposito & Aaron Zhao's Android Textbook App API Documentation</h1>

This page contains the documentation for our application's API, which is as of now only implemented by our app.<br>
The url format is: https://uaa-cse2.duckdns.org:8080/api?token=XXX&action=XXX&table=XXX...

<h2>Required:</h2>

<b>token</b><br>
Preface every request with this. It MUST be a valid token coming from our app verified with oAuth.<br>
We will not accept requests from any other source.<br><br>

<b>action</b><br>
One of: select, insert, delete, update<br>
Which correspond to their MySQL counterparts.<br><br>

<b>table</b><br>
The table name to modify. Usually Sale.<br><br>

<h2>Optional:</h2>
Afterward, you can add additional fields to the url. They will be implemented in the appropriate way for the action type.<br>
Example: ...&action=select&table=Sale&SellerID=Gabriel  will turn into "SELECT * FROM `Sale` WHERE SellerID = Gabriel;"

<h2>Notes:</h2>


The server will send back the response in application/json format.<br>
There will always be an <i>error</i> field.<br>
If the token field is invalid, the server will respond with 401 Unauthorized.<br>
(Certain implementations of HTTP calls on android will return filenotfound IOexception if they get a 401)
